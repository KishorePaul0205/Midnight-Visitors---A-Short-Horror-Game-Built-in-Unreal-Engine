# Midnight Visitors – A Short Horror Game Built in Unreal Engine

**Midnight Visitors** is a short, atmospheric horror game built using **Unreal Engine 5**. Designed as part of a learning project, it focuses on building tension and unease through visuals, sound design, and subtle horror elements — all created using Blueprint scripting.

## 🎮 Game Overview

After midnight, strange things begin to happen...

You're alone, or so it seems. Explore a dark and mysterious environment where each step might bring you face-to-face with the unknown. With minimal UI and no combat, the game leans entirely on atmosphere and immersion.
